 * Navigation bar links with names and link.

 * The name is what is displayed in the navigation bar. The link is the hyperlink reference. It is 
 * displayed from left to right in order of appearance in this array.
 * 
 * The name doubles as a react `key` for the `.map` function. Try to keep this as a single word. I
 * *think* that react requires `key`s to be a single word.
