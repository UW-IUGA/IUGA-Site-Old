 * 
 * TODO: While the file itself is not scalable, users should not see any noticable performance impact since
 * the pages are rendered server side and sent down to the user. However, we may have to adjust how
 * the user receives the pages. They may be getting all the data at once.
 * 
 * Honestly it's so little data that it shouldnt matter unless you read this 20 years from now and IUGA

I want to keep up the good work and build on the foundation laid by our fantastic current executive board, and make sure the Informatics program grows even more relevant, more useful, and of course- more fun.

				statement: "Just a short two weeks ago, I celebrated the anniversary of the day I fell in love with Informatics- Winter Quarter Game Night of my sophomore year. That night planted the seed in my head that not only did I have to join this wonderful group of people, but I also knew that I wanted to be the voice of everyone from the dedicated designer to the peppy PM. So at my first opportunity, I applied to be a First Year Representative and was absolutely thrilled to get a chance to have a step in that direction. As I met more people, even though I had been excited about the major before, I came to not only see how great it was, but also how much potential this group of people had. We’re the future of technology, and carry some of the most passionate designers, developers and thinkers out there. As Vice President, I know it would be my duty to not only foster this talent in our major, but also to show everyone else at UW, Seattle and the tech field what amazing things we will bring to the table. I plan on delivering this in a few ways first and foremost by focusing on freshman-oriented events. For example, Informatics info sessions and panels advertised in classes that freshman who are interested in tech related fields but may not yet have direction would attend. Also, working together with other tech fields (yes, even CSE) to create a presence to lost freshmen who haven’t found us yet. Additionally, to bring the greater community in, I plan on using some connections I have built at Microsoft from my internships, and establishing a list of connections of those within our major to create events to teach businesses we are exactly what they have been looking for all of these years. I am honored to accept my nomination for Vice President of IUGA, and look forward to getting the chance to surprise you guys day in and day out with what I plan on bringing to the table. Thank you."

I am very good at planning events with my friends and connecting the group together, and I believe I would be able to communicate announcements with the association very well and represent the school very well. This being said I can also coordinate the social events for the ischool from my skills doing this as vice president of the rocketry club in High School, i mean its not rocket science (HA HA). I already know a few individuals I would elect for my marketing team to make sure the ischool maintains its brand and keeps a good social media presence. I think i would be good at this because my organization and time management skills will be put to good use being on the board of IUGA. The most important reason I feel like i would be a good fit for this position is that I am sociable and love meeting people, especially informatics students and as a director of public relations I am sure it will be necessary to have many conversations with those in my cohort and in the year below me and my motivations come from my natural interests in the department."

This quarter, I am running for Director of Public Relations with greater goals in mind: to unify our major as a family and make our years here a time to remember. I know I’m not alone when I say that two of the best parts of being in informatics (excluding my raps) are the awesome IUGA swag sales and the many events we host so that we can interact and bond. As a candidate for the Director of PR, I understand just how important our brand and our events are to the major. I also understand that to be able to represent us, I must have your interests and feedback in mind. To accomplish this, I plan to assemble and lead a marketing team comprised of our finest with the purpose of designing sick new swag (that awesome scarf, anyone?). Likewise, IUGA events will be open to suggestion and heavily influenced by popular demand (mint chip ice cream is king). The truth is, after only a quarter and a half of being in major, I genuinely know that the iSchool is much more than just our school; it’s our home. The people I’ve met and the experiences I’ve had thus far are priceless, and I would love nothing more than to share these moments and create new ones with the rest of the major and next year’s cohort. I am Kevin Yan, and I sincerely hope that you put your faith in me to make our time unforgettable; I won’t let you down."

For me, the major has always meant much more than just a degree. It’s an opportunity to come together with my classmates to create something unforgettable. IUGA has been a great facilitator for these connections. From the networking nights to the game nights to the first year events, I’ve been able to meet and spend time with some great people. Additionally, working as a first year representative has given me experience planning these events and appreciation of them.\nIt is because of these experiences that the Director of Finance isn’t just a position to me— it’s a commitment. Not only to maintaining the financial accounts of IUGA, but to continue building the iSchool community. I want to work with the Director of Public Relations to consistently provide as many opportunities to IUGA members as possible. More iSchool apparel orders, career information sessions and after school events are all on my list. I also want to coordinate with the Director of Outreach to fiscally secure these events through outside sources. Getting company sponsors for game nights, guest speakers for our information sessions, and company tours are all ways I want to continue to extend the breadth of opportunities that IUGA provides. The chance to manage IUGA’s budget and fundraising efforts offers ways to promote growth in my community, something I am passionate about. I don’t want this position to just count numbers on a spreadsheet—I want it to count numbers that matter. Numbers, ledgers and estimates that let us come together and continue to build on the amazing environment we have at the iSchool."

I’m excited to be nominated, especially for an important role such as this.\nThere are a lot of responsibilities involved to being the director of diversity efforts. From planning events to being a part of various committees…however, I believe that the most important responsibility is to help foster diversity and help others engage in diversity-related topics or challenges. The Director of Diversity Efforts is a role full of important duties. All of which I am ready, and excited, to take on. I want to be the Director because I want to be at the forefront of helping foster diversity within the Informatics. I would like to be part of group that can create and implement changes that ensure that our school is full of students from different backgrounds. This role is most than just being part of a student organization. For me, this role is about creating an environment where everyone feels valued and supported and help create opportunities for others.\nI would be a good fit for this role for various reasons. I am part of the Information School’s Diversity Committee Board. Being a part of this board has exposed me to several insights on how much work is involved to plan events, what kinds of events the committee wants to do, and how to create events that will be educational for everyone. Most importantly, this board has showed me how diversity can help us become more open and learn new perspectives from others.\nSecond, I am a volunteer at the Ethnic Cultural Center at the UW campus. I help create boards surrounding the issues of social justice and create resources for cultural RSOs to use in many of their workshops. Lastly, I currently work as a Human Resources student assistant on campus. On a day-to-day basis, I get to communicate with students from various backgrounds and help them get jobs on campus. I have learned that when you help create opportunities at an individual level, it can leave a lasting impression on that person. That being said, I would like to dedicate my time and my skills and apply it as your new Director of Diversity Efforts.\nIf given the opportunity to be the new Director of Diversity Efforts, I will support my peers and prospective students to become successful individuals."

Supporting a diverse body of iSchool students will reaffirm that we represent the intersection of information, technology, and above all: people.\nEngaging with Women in Informatics (WINFO), iQueeries, and iEquality will be one of my primary steps to help shape the iSchool as an integrated force for advancing the equity, the voice, and the representation of underserved and historically excluded communities. As an ally, I aim to ensure the iSchool as a safe intersectional space for LGBTQQ students, students of color, and students of diverse ability. Expanding diversity-focused events and workshops aimed at creating a visible and vocal community of students from these communities will be of utmost concern. I hope to leverage my experience in AES (American Ethnic Studies), my organizing activities as secretary of the HCDE Student Association, and my experiences in America as a person of color to passionately engage and organize diversity efforts at the iSchool. In addition to supporting current students, I aim to strengthen community outreach efforts for prospective students interested in Informatics who are from underserved communities. Creating an environment where all feel welcome to pursue the study of Informatics will reflect our confidence as a school working at the leading-edge of the study of information, technology, and people."

The current IUGA executive board has done a great job thus far welcoming the new cohort, maintaining the strong relationship with the iSchool faculty and staff, and planning events for the student body.\nI want to be the next IUGA president because ever since I first heard of Informatics, I was hooked.

I got to learn about the different opportunities within the major, and I realized how interested I was in cybersecurity and data science. With our community, we can establish lasting and meaningful connections.\nThe IUGA president must be able to represent the Informatics major, both to prospective students and as liaison between the iSchool faculty, staff, and students.

In my spare time, I enjoy running, playing league of legends or Call of Duty, and shopping for food.\nWith a few years of working retail and other odd jobs, I have been able to focus on the customer relationship side of the work industry.

After that position, I moved to being an Orientation Leader for this past summer. In the OL position, I helped introduced hundreds to thousands of incoming students to the UW campus with a team and worked extensively to help make sure they knew every resource possible. After this previous summer, I started as an Intern working for CDW. In that position, I conversed and worked with IT directors in all of the UW departments to help integrate technology to help in any way possible.\nI am passionate about inclusion, diversity, and leadership development. Currently I am studying Informatics (like all of you) and am focusing in Information Assurance & Cyber security!

Our community is unique in its inclusiveness, engagement, fun, and creativity. I have yet to meet a single Info major, or even prospective, that wasn’t excited and enthusiastic about contributing towards making Informatics great. As Info 200 TA, i’ve meet hundreds of prospectives and incoming students, and from attending and even hosting Info events i’ve gotten to know many of the current and former Info majors. The one common thread amongst them all is a personal drive to make things better, more fun, and more engaging.\nThe most important thing i’ve learned from this positive community environment, is that it is not an accident. Behind the scenes there are many organizers, many people putting up money, time, energy, and their reputations on the line to make sure that the stage is set for a positive community. Specifically, it’s the relentless drive of a few individuals determined to make sure that stage is set, that guarantees that the core driver of a positive community isn’t dissolved and slowly phased out. Recognition of this, and a personal drive to be the spearhead in driving the positivity and engagement of the community, is why I want to be Director of PR. A great community happens when someone makes it happen, I want to be that someone, I want to both continue the tradition of Info being a fun place to be, and make it better than it ever was before."

I’d say it’s like taking a blender, putting in challenges and support, and mixing the two together to create an experience that helps you really learn and grow as a person. What do I mean? Well the classes will spank you outside your comfort zone and catapult you into this new area you were too scared to explore before. But by taking risks, you can reach a lot of accomplishments that you didn’t think you were capable of doing before. Now there are going to be times when these challenges get harder and harder and life just uppercuts you in the throat and you get knocked down.

My natural tendencies to help others solidified as I grew and as I learned about the sacrifices my parents made to escape Vietnam in order to give me a better life. Inspired by their stories and selflessness, I worked hard to be an asset to my communities by holding positions such as library helper, tutor for youth, patrol member, member of National Honor Society, and more. From being a first generation college student, being exposed to adversity because of my family culture, and from interacting with so many diverse groups of people, I know that I, Royce, will be the voice and helping hand for anyone who ever feels or have felt underrepresented or underappreciated in the Informatics community. I have made the choice to choose love and to choose to see the best in situations, in people, and to try and bring the incandescent potential out of everything. My parents always said “Bắt cá hai tay”! Which translates to you catch fish with two hands. So I have always dared myself to never take for granted the opportunities that my parents gave me, and here and now I will dare the Informatics community to find out what is their fish, what are they hungry for, and challenge them to reach out with both hands, through the roaring river of adversity and emerging out the river with hands held high, scathed, exhausted, and victorious.\nI hope you that you strongly consider Royce Le for the Director of Diversity, thank you.\nRoyce Le"

Other than that, I think I covered my strengths well enough in my video, so I’ll just take this opportunity to talk about myself… Keep reading if you want to know some random facts about me.\nI’ll start off with my favorite movies – animation-wise, How To Train Your Dragon and The Incredibles. As for live-action films, I’m a huge fan of the Dark Knight trilogy as well as Love Actually. I used to play the cello, and some of my best memories growing up were from playing in orchestras. I love to dance, but I’m not that great at it… I’ve been vegetarian since the 5th grade because I really loved (and still love) dogs, and reasoned that if I wouldn’t eat a dog, then I shouldn’t eat other animals either. I cry very easily at sad or sentimental situations, and am not ashamed to admit that I’ve teared up multiple times while binge-watching ATLA.  My favorite fruit is strawberry, my favorite flavor is chocolate, and my favorite type of food is Italian though I would never say no to Pad Thai and spring rolls at Araya’s. Lastly, I’d actually love to get to know more of the iUGA community, so please feel free to introduce yourself to me sometime or shoot me a message on Facebook! (Don’t believe anything Kevin says about me, I’m actually really nice :3 )"

Like most international students, I struggled telling people about my name and culture, as some of them never tried to understand the meaning behind these identities. However, being in the Informatics program and involved in IUGA has been a wonderful experience, as I’ve found my second home where I feel connected with everyone.\nDuring my two years in Informatics, I've always felt included and welcomed into our community. INFO alums are always willing to help us prepare for jobs and internships. There are always iHangouts for us to meet current and prospective INFO students and professional events held by IUGA and Winfo to help us learn about different opportunities. Even small things, such as, people trying to remember my Chinese name, and always helping each other in TE lab, have made me feel included - thus, shaping my perspective on inclusiveness and diversity.\nI’m running for President of IUGA, because I want to make sure everyone feels welcomed in our community. Furthermore, previous IUGA presidents have exclusively only been men. As a woman of color from a different cultural background than most, I hope this election and my presidency will encourage more people, especially those of underrepresented communities, to get involved in their community and pursue leadership positions. As an Orientation Leader, Campus Tour Guide and Informatics Diversity Ambassador, I always tell incoming students and families how amazing Informatics is and how much I love this program because of its inclusiveness and diversity. And as President, I’ll keep collaborating with other IUGA officers and iSchool groups, such as Winfo, iEquality, iQueeries, to support this community by connecting everyone together ☺"

Only then can we make them into something tangibly profound. Something that can communicate a meaningful experience.\nI live in the intersection of that process. My name is Saif, and I want to be the next Creative Director of IUGA.\nI remember my first interaction with Informatics. I remember it so clearly because it was the first time someone questioned my thinking that way. I took the Mobile App Design class in Fall 2015. This was the first INFO class I had taken, and I wasn’t even in the major. This class was an eye-opening experience for me because it made me realize that I had a natural eye for design – and I didn’t even know. It's what started my love for Informatics, and showed me a world of endless possibilities.\nOn July 28th, 2016, I was accepted into the Informatics major. This was indeed one of the greatest moments of my life.\nSince then, with each project I have committed to in my INFO classes, I’ve observed that the more I was learning about design academically, the “less” I was designing in action. Informatics put me in an arena where I began to craft around intention of efficiency through simplicity. It educated me with not just the robust technicality of design, but also help me focus on forming a deep understanding of human values.\nAs Creative Director of IUGA, I look forward to contributing my design thinking and leadership skills to exemplify what IUGA and Informatics stand for. It would be an honor to be part of an organization that highlights the essence of what Informatics is: People, Technology, Mentorship, Inspiration, and Opportunity.\nCheck out www.saifmustafa.com to see some of the work I've done – this should give you a better sense of what I love to do and what makes me want to wake up each morning.\nThank you!"

I want to help the Informatics community be even more close knit and for everyone to come to events without the financial burden. All you have to do is add IUGA events to your calendars and show up! Meanwhile, I will work hard to find sponsors, secure finances, and have that monetary stability that will allow us to keep organizing your favorite events. \nIn the past, I have taken care of budgets in various leadership roles, one was as treasurer for Operation Smile and the other is the floor budget as an RA. In both these roles, I have stayed organized and kept the budget up to date, so I know I will be able to do that for this role, too. I have handled our RSO merchandise, found great sponsors, and fundraised extensively for our events. I will listen to each of you to understand what events you want and then make that happen! \nOne of my favorite parts of Informatics is how diverse every person is and with IUGA’s events we are all able to come together and have a great time!

This past year getting to know the students in our community has been an absolute pleasure. I would like to accept my nomination in order to give back to this community that has given me so much. \nExperiences that I've had that make me qualified for this position include working as a student assistant for UW's Office of Finance and Administration and as a First-Year Representative for IUGA. Working at the Office of Finance and Administration, I helped out with budget reconciliation. While some people might find this boring, I understood how important keeping track of finances is for an organization. As your First Year Representative this year, I've had the pleasure of helping organize social and professional events to bring together our community. I've noticed that a lot of our social events require our members to spend money. While these restaurant hangouts are fun, I propose a wider variety of events. Events such as the Movie Night we hosted last quarter and the potluck event encourage more involvement. \nAs the Director of Finance, I would want to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. This job is not just about budgets and numbers. It's about making things work logistically to the benefit you. I want to work together with the director of public relations and the director of outreach to plan events that you want. Afterall, our jobs are to work for you. Thank you for your time and consideration IUGA. \nThanks,\nAnton Zheng"

I have come to really love this community and all the opportunities it has provided me. I believe diversity in the informatics major is definitely something that could be improved upon.  I myself come from a Muslim-American background and have been apart of the Muslim Student Association. My role in the MSA was to spread awareness of my organization and bring in as many people as possible. Throughout my time doing this I have made personal connections with a lot of other organizations on campus such as the Middle Eastern Student Commission, the Pakistani Student Association, the Somali Student Association, and many more. I understand how to get to organizations that are underrepresented in Informatics because I am greatly involved with them. I also understand that diversity doesn’t just mean different looking people, it also means different genders, sexual orientations, and ways of thought. I want to reach out to those communities just as I have reached out to the other many organizations. I also think that diversity is a community effort. If you are apart of a community that you don’t see represented in our community than by all means, feel free to reach out to me.

My name is Katie, and I am so excited to be running for Director of Diversity Efforts! \nDiversity is one of my core values and I use it to guide my actions to positively influence my community. I believe in seeking new perspectives (especially ones in opposition of my own) to gain insight into societal inequities and its relationship to diversity. I am confident that my experiences, leadership, and passion will make me a qualified director. \nFor the last five years, I have had the incredible opportunity to volunteer as a summer camp counselor for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. More recently, this year I have become a weekly volunteer at ROOTS, a young adult shelter in the University District. These opportunities have provided me with ineffable knowledge centered around systemic oppression and diversity, and I am excited to bring a new perspective of accessibility and inclusivity to Informatics. Additionally, I actively seek out courses in the Gender Women's and Sexuality Studies department to better understand the societal inequities faced by people who identify within racial, gender, or sexual minority groups and learning how I can become a stronger ally. \nFor almost two years, I have been a TA for introductory Informatics courses. As a TA, I feel it is my responsibility to use the platform of an educator to share the knowledge, importance, and influence of diversity, especially to prospective students. I do this through a technical lens, presenting how data driven systems have the potential to perpetuate systemic inequities. \nWhat makes Informatics so special to me is the welcoming and warm community. I want all Informatics students to share that feeling and bring our community of amazing, unique individuals closer together. If elected, I want to focus on improving diversity within the classroom, highlight the challenges minorities face in Informatics and the technology field, and ensure prospective students know we are a community committed to diversity. In doing this, I ultimately want to channel my enthusiasm and passion for diversity to create a more inclusive environment where we all have the opportunity to succeed in the major and beyond."

Change can start with us. \nTo me the iSchool is a community and a place to feel welcome. Within the iSchool I want to work to create a diverse and inclusive environment where we celebrate each individuals diversity and are able to have open conversations about diversity and representation. \nI want to work on creating more inclusivity and diversity in the iSchool through further working with the iSchool community to see what we can do to create opportunities for underrepresented groups and increasing our number of and awareness of marginalized groups within the iSchool and make all feel welcome.

First of all, let me mention how humbling of an experience it is to be nominated and running for this position. As a Taiwanese American, I grew up getting comments of, “where are you really from?” I don’t look American, but since I am also tan skinned, I get comments that I don’t look Taiwanese. So, I struggled in finding my own niche in society. When I first entered the Informatics program at University of Washington, I was amazed by the welcoming feeling that I got from the community. I am passionate about Informatics and similarly to the inviting experience I felt, I hope to use technology to make others feel welcomed too by providing academic support to IUGA or anyone interested in learning more about this wonderful community. \nAs a student coming from California, I understand the needs of students struggling to find their place in a different environment. I have too gone through the same thing, and I want to be able to provide academic support to ease the worries of other students. One of the best ways to make IUGA community feel more inclusive is to provide warm and inviting events to bring people together and learn more about academics. \nAs a previous RSO president for Husky Table Tennis Club, I believe I am capable in my skills of teamwork, leadership, and the spread of knowledge. With these skills I will host gathering events with the intention to share knowledge amongst one another. Although all Informatic students are talented, there can sometimes be that sense of insecurity amongst one another and I hope that I can provide for the extra academical resources to make all of IUGA feel more confident and also thus preparing for the real world. \nTo also gauge what students are interested or where they are struggling, I strive to provide as a communication medium and listen to the thoughts on what IUGA wants to learn. From the responses, I can better understand the academic needs of current students and create more opportunities, such as hands on projects, small academic seminars, hangouts with professionals to gain connections, etc. Whatever it takes, I will push to meet the needs of the students of IUGA. I want to be the Academic Director, because I want to help students be successful. Remember, there are multiple ways you can take to succeed, but follow my way, “Wesley Wei”."

Regardless of my attitude, every time I would help her she would thank me. 'Thank you, Joseph! Show me how to do that again so I won’t need to ask next time.' \nHer willingness to learn throughout the years taught me a valuable lesson about helping others: Don’t just offer a one-time solution. Work as a team to obtain the necessary knowledge and resources to succeed. \nThat’s what I want to do for you, with you. \nI want to understand the academic needs of both prospective and current Informatics students and proactively present resources that will help students succeed.

One of the most common questions I have continuously been asked by my peers is - What is Informatics? From my time at UW so far, I have realized that not many people are aware about this major. Informatics is often considered as a backup for CS, but this was not the case for me. My first priority had always been Informatics which helped me get direct admission into the major and I have been blessed to be a part of this wonderful community since day one. Networking, one of the key elements for professional development, can be a scary concept for college students who are transforming into working adults. I want to be able to help students build professional connections outside college. The process of finding internships and building connections in the industry can seem frustrating and difficult for many students and I want to be there to help them ease in the process. With technology rapidly growing and changing in our world, it is important to be aware of how these changes are affecting the industry. While classes teach us the hard skills, there still exists a gap in being connected to the industry. I want to be able to work towards bridging that gap. Some ideas that I have to connect students are  - hosting mentorship programs with industry professionals, having industry panel sessions, hosting networking nights and also having company tours and information sessions. Currently, I am an officer of an RSO on campus called NEXUS UW where I work towards connecting students with Seattle’s non profit organizations to enable them to work on live projects. I want to be able to do something similar for the broader iSchool community. I look forward to helping iSchool students connect to the resources they need to succeed.

Another aspect of my life that I believe will make me an effective Creative Director is that I have a strong interest in fashion. Fashion to me is all about expressing yourself. Informatics is a big part of who we all are, and I want to design clothing and merchandise that starts conversations, and truly shows what Informatics is. The iSchool is full of bright, innovative, and loving people and I wish to help create gear and posters that represents that. Overall, I’m just really grateful for everything IUGA has done in helping me feel included in the Informatics community, and I want to give back by hopefully being your next IUGA Creative Director. Thank you!"

				statement: "Hello IUGA! \n My name is Sean Kim and I am running to be your 2019 2020 Director of Information Technology. Fall quarter of freshman year, I joined a FIG and it was a time for me to get a feel for the college atmosphere but also a time to learn about my interests. I had a passive interest for Business which faded away quickly due to the lack of technical development. Next was computer science but where was the emphasis on users? The way we use so-called “tech”, what we build with it, and the like? Aren’t I, you, and we all users, per se, of technology? This is what I want to emphasize during my time as the director of IT for IUGA; to ensure that students know how to use the iSchool technologies and services, especially the latest tools that are to come during my term. Providing support in technology services for a vast array of people is second nature, as I have experience working as a Web Tools Consultant at the Odegaard Library as a Sophomore. During this time, I assisted students, faculty, and staff with services such as Canvas, Catalyst, Panopto, and Poll Everywhere. I have further experience working in IT as I have worked at the IT Helpdesk and this past summer, I interned at Expeditors as a PC Support Intern. My experience and ability to serve a diverse group of people will allow me to be successful as your Director of IT. My hope is to provide the necessary resources to help students, faculty, and staff thrive to learn new skills and find opportunities to grow. Thank you!"

Previously as a Teaching Assistant for Client Side Development and as an Undergraduate Tutor, I noticed a lack of information on frequently asked questions, a lack of clear explanations and examples for all sections of courses to access, and a lack of ready help. I have already taken steps towards solving some of these issues with my Informatics Hub and Tutor Queue applications, but I believe a lot more has to be done in order for our Informatics community to flourish even more. My main goal as your Director of IT is to use technology to enrich the student experience in Informatics. First, I will hear the technological needs of our students and work closely with our department to make it a reality. I will work towards upkeep of all technology related to IUGA as well. Most importantly, I will use technology to increase the strength of connections within the Informatics community. I see the Informatics community as my second family. I want the Informatics program to grow and produce even more successful individuals. We all should want that. I will do everything I can to take large strides in that direction.

Often times, when we think of academics, we tend to feel intimidated, stressed and scared. I strongly believe in creating a safe space for all types of academic and career interests. I hope to engage in the community in a way that brings the fun into education. I do realize that all of us have different strengths and weaknesses but with the right resources and support everyone can have a pleasant experience! Having moved to the US from Africa where I was not really exposed to technical or design classes has definitely been a challenge. However, through the support of iSchool advisors and the Informatics community I feel that I have managed to build a support system. I look forward to helping you connect with people who can relate to your interests and challenges to build your support system. As a Resident Advisor, I constantly try to foster a community that focusses on inclusivity and open-mindedness regardless of one’s interests. Similarly, as Director of Academic Support I hope to help continue to build an inclusive community amongst Informatics students. After volunteering for several years at local schools in Zambia, I have realized that working with the right people can help make school exciting and fun! Additionally, by helping out at non-profit organizations that work to provide education to low-income students, I have realized the impact academics can have on one’s life. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any ideas or requests! I’d be more than happy to incorporate them. I hope to make this upcoming year one for the books! "

When I began my university career, I was immediately drawn to the Information School because of our commitment to community and social good while studying topics that define the frontier of today’s tech-centric world. Over the past few years, Informatics has gained incredible traction becoming one of the most popular majors on campus. But as we continue to grow in size, I think it’s vital that we do not forsake the community we work so hard to foster. That is what I want to focus on in the upcoming year.\nI believe the feeling of community will be achieved when all Informatics students know each other by name. This will change the dynamic inside class and outside to be more collaborative in nature, which will no doubt increase the quality of work we put in and get out of our education. After all, studying is more exciting when you’re having fun! Check out my video below for details of how I want to tackle this next year!\nWhen I got into Informatics, I immediately wanted to get involved and joined IUGA as a First-Year Representative. This year I am serving as your IUGA Director of Finance. Next year will be my third year in this major and the experiences I have had so far creating new events like Demystifying the Tracks, managing budgets, and bringing your opinions and suggestions to the Student Leadership Committee has prepared me for the position of IUGA President.

I’m so grateful to be a part of this welcoming community that has helped me truly feel a part of this large university. In high school, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to study until I heard about Informatics at UW’s admitted student preview day. Hearing that I could creatively connect individuals to technology sparked my interest in Informatics, but what stood out to me was the supportive and inclusive iSchool community that provided me academic and professional guidance even as a prospective student. After getting the opportunity to be a part of the iSchool, I planned on giving back to provide the next generation of Informatics students the same encouraging community I received. This year, I got the opportunity to be an IUGA first- year representative where I helped prospective students connect with the iSchool through student panels to hackathons. I have seen collaboration be a core value of the iSchool and I hope to continue to build on collaboration for the coming year. I will work hard in bringing the student body closer together through creating opportunities where students can voice their thoughts and challenges to officers and faculty. As college is a time for personal and professional growth, I hope to provide opportunities for open discussions about how to improve the ethics of technology, invite industry professionals to share their work to inspire students, and reach out to companies to create company tours and workshops.

My name is Ana and I am a third-year undergrad from the Bay Area. In my time as an Informatics student, I've grown to love and appreciate the supportive community I've unexpectedly found here. With each new class and group project, I’ve been surrounded by peers who encourage and challenge me, both academically and personally. The iSchool is a place where my ideas take flight. A place to express myself. A place that's gradually becoming my home away from home. I am running for IUGA's Director of Outreach to further immerse myself in this community and shape this program into a space my peers can call home, too Outreach is all about bridging the gap between students and professional opportunities. Some of my biggest achievements, including getting my first on-campus job and landing a summer internship, stemmed from my attendance at Informatics-related events.

On my first day of school, a girl yelled out \“What is wrong with his eyes\” to the whole class as soon as I entered the classroom. I was rather confused at that moment.

I have been always passionate about visual design and have half a decade of experience of designing key visions and event advertising materials. Before entering the University, I have not considered too much of how to convert my passion into a career. Taking INFO 101 during my first quarter answered the question of where and how I can contribute my passion and what are the meaningful things I should do to help more people. \nI received huge amounts of support from people in the iSchool during the anxious application days, and I gradually understood the core value in the community of inclusion, diversity, and creativity. I want to uphold these ideals and maintain the image of the iSchool as a place where people who are passionate about information technology and innovation can interact, explore, and help create a better world. The position of Creative Director allows me to contribute my knowledge and experiences to meet these goals. \nAlong with collaborating with other officers holding and advertising IUGA events, I want to illustrate the creativity, diversity, and passion within every person in the iSchool. By upgrading and uniform the iSchool visual elements, I want to make the iSchool brand recognizable throughout the campus. In our posters, banners, and merchandise, applying these visual elements will help popularize the iSchool icon and draw more people to understand what the iSchool is and what ideas we hold. I want to be part of the IUGA team, support people in/out of school like people supporting me, spread our enthusiasm and vision to wider audiences and draw my life at the iSchool to perfect end.",

I’ve been shooting photos for the last 5 years, ranging from portraits, weddings, events, high school seniors, college graduations, family, and even engagement photos. My absolute favorite aspect of photography comes with the emotions that I’m able to capture for each person that I work with. I hope to capture all of the best moments for the students within the iSchool and help highlight all the incredible feats that the students do achieve. \nAnother recent experience comes with my 2 years working in professional videography settings. The power and emotion that can come from a single video are truly an incredible thing. I hope to evoke more of this to help unify and bring our students together through the year to come. \nAt the same time, I’ve led as the creative lead for the past 3 years at my college fellowship group, ConXion. I’ve built up our team from the ground up and have experience working alongside other students to create incredible pieces of work. \nOverall, my goal is to bring my past experiences in the creative field to help the iSchool students shine brighter to the world around us. IUGA has made a tremendous impact on my experience as an Informatics student and my goal would be to continue its vision of welcoming future students and truly making the iSchool their home away from home.",

It didn’t take long for me to feel comfortable in this new community, and a big part of that is due to IUGA.

IUGA has helped me feel like I’m part of a community even though I’m 954 miles away from Seattle. \nI’m running for the Director of Outreach position because I want to plan events similar to the ones that helped me grow professionally. I’ll continue to organize informational sessions, but I’ll also increase the amount of events with companies. Since everything has gone virtual, it can feel harder to connect with professionals. However, I’ll work to bridge that gap by planning networking workshops and Q&A sessions with employers.

I am a sophomore majoring in the Human Computer Interaction track of Informatics and was admitted as a freshman in 2019. I grew up in a variety of academic settings. I attended private schools, public schools, and even schools abroad. Each time I was placed in a new environment, the idea of being included and represented in unfamiliar settings overwhelmed me. In certain settings, there were definitely moments I felt discriminated against and disrespected whether it was intentional or not. That is where my passion for diversity and inclusivity stems from. \nThere are many students in the Informatics program, and everyone comes from different backgrounds and stories. In such a community, while it can be difficult to create an environment that equally hears all of these voices and recognizes the differences, I have always felt accepted and heard. Within classes, events, and even just light conversations with people in this community, there has never been a moment where I did not feel appreciated. \nI would love to continue promoting this inclusive environment as a Director of Diversity.

Oftentimes, it’s simple to conflate diversity with representation. Instead, I hope to push the iSchool for diversity that maintains a proactive awareness of race, ethnicity, religion, sexuality, gender, socioeconomic backgrounds, etc., and the disparate structural and interpersonal barriers that impact students and faculty. \nGenerating challenging conversations with leadership, I want to push the iSchool to be a major and community intent on cultivating students invested in equity; a community that is not reactionary, but radically becoming better. Working with the Diversity Programs Advisor, Diversity Committee, IUGA, and various groups and RSOs, as your Director of Diversity, I will strive to prioritize the demands of the people and our spaces. \nIn my time within the iSchool, I have greatly admired the conversations faculty and students have had and strongly believe I have the dedication to expand and cultivate those same discussions. At the intersection of tech, design, and human values, it’s necessary that the iSchool has a distinct awareness of the nuanced socio-technical impacts technology has had and continues to have and I hope to be part of a group of people dedicated to understanding and highlighting that.

As a Peer Advisor for the iSchool, I have had the opportunity to mentor incoming informatics students and share my passion for the field.My experiences with IUGA have taught me a lot about what informatics students actually want, and if elected, I will prioritize three main initiatives. First off, I want us to go crazy on merch next year by hosting design competitions every quarter. This will provide a platform for anyone in the informatics community to showcase their creativity and contribute to the iSchool. We will vote on the designs, and the chosen ones will be produced and sold to the community. Design winners get free merch!! I also plan on giving out free merch to students who win competitions at events like IUGA Game Night :) Second, I plan to bring back big “social” (drinking👀) events, such as iBall, which has been absent from the event calendar for far too long. Last year, we successfully revived iCruise, and this year we are bringing back iBBQ. I believe that social events are crucial to foster a sense of community within the informatics program. Lastly, I aim to increase our recruitment events, timed right before internships are released for specific companies. This will allow students to connect with potential employers, learn about internship opportunities, and get a head start on the application process.

				statement: "My name is Sheamin Kim and I’m a first-year undergraduate student here at the iSchool running for Creative Director of IUGA. Now usually, this is where I start telling you exactly why I am a good candidate. I’d start talking about my leadership experiences in high school as an officer in Key Club and National Honor Society. Then I’d transition into mentioning my current leadership roles as treasurer of the RSO DEV[0] as well as Head Coxswain of the Union Bay Rowing Club. I’d probably also sprinkle some mentions of my experiences with coding and design, maybe mentioning my WINFO Hackathon Finalist title. Then to make myself sound a little less like a resume, I would talk about my hobbies, which happen to be crochet, embroidery, and baking. But why would I do that? It’s not a very creative way to introduce myself. So instead, let’s talk about you. I don’t really know whom you might be- there are lots of students at the iSchool. But I know one thing- you deserve a good Creative Director. One you can rely on to work for you, to turn your requests into tangible results. And I think I can be the one to offer that to you. Not because I’m an amazing person necessarily, but because you all are. You are a group of fabulous students of the iSchool, people who surprise me every day by reaching new heights and bringing things into my worldview that shock and fascinate me. People whose opinions deserve to be heard. So, no matter my shortcomings, I’ll always be striving to be better for the people of the iSchool, because they deserve nothing other than my absolute best effort. Next time I greet you, I hope it is as your new Creative Director."

				statement: "Hey there INFO! I’m Tiffany Chen, and I’m running for president because Informatics is so much more than just a major to me - it’s a community. Being able to work with winfo officers as a First Year Representative these past few months has been among the best opportunities I’ve had to give back to info, and continuing with winfo in the capacity of president would allow me to do so much more. I consider myself extremely fortunate to be a part of Informatics, and the one who led me to this major left me with an idea: that he had someone who helped him find his home in the major, which inspired him to help others find their place, creating a cycle that would help Informatics continue to embody the welcoming environment that distinguishes it from other majors.\nThat community is something I’ve always felt is inherently part of what Informatics truly is. I want to keep building this community up, making it stronger and always trying to find new opportunities not only to engage with all the brilliant students that make up info, but also to cultivate new opportunities for informatics students wherever possible. That might be through making new connections for more company tours, or expanding our hackathon to have even more great sponsors, or making entirely new events to help students along with the entire process of getting from college to the workforce.\nThat’s just some of what I want to do. A lot of that is focused on expanding established winfo practices, but we’re a fast growing major, which means a lot of change, including a new program chair, a new dean, a whole new application process - and I want to make sure our voices aren’t lost. I want to make sure that any of our concerns are presented to the people who can make a difference, and that we don’t have to compromise on any of the things that we joined info for just because things are changing. I look forward to working with you all, and let’s keep info true to itself."

I don’t usually run, unless it's after ice cream trucks, but despite this I’m running because I am passionate about Winfo’s mission of creating a more inclusive tech industry community here at the UW and beyond.\nBeing a part of the Informatics community this past year has been amazing! I have loved getting to know more Informatics students, from the constant late nights in the TE lab to the shared experience of 343 bringing us all closer together.\nAs your Director of PR my goals will be orientated towards inclusion, outreach, and involvement. Once elected I plan to start next year by introducing member spotlights and weekly newsletters. These member spotlights would be to celebrate our amazing Winfo members by featuring a bi-weekly spotlight on the fantastic people we have within our community. There are over 670 members in the Winfo Facebook group, that’s a lot of incredible people we can and should highlight! The weekly newsletters would be emails that would contain information about what’s happening within Winfo as well as upcoming Winfo events. This way you can stay in the loop and have greater access to a reliable source of information.\nTransparency and approachability are important values to me, so feel free to slide into my dms at anytime, but I also plan on creating an anonymous survey where you can send us your thoughts and suggestions. As Director of PR, I value your opinion and will work with you all to improve and grow Winfo.\nThe Director of PR for Winfo must be able to connect and promote Winfo to students and other UW communities. From my experiences as a First Year Representative for Winfo and as a TA, I have been able to connect with students within Informatics to attend Winfo events as well as encourage prospective students to become more involved with Winfo’s mission of diversity.\nI'm looking forward to being your Director of PR, but I can't do this alone. I need your vote to help shape the future of Winfo and to reach and connect with more Informatics students. Together we can and will make Winfo better and stronger."

I tortured myself with gen chem, accounting, econ and bio, not knowing what I wanted to major in. I feel incredibly fortunate to have discovered and been admitted to Informatics.\nUW is a huge school that can easily feel lonely and isolating making the community Informatics fosters priceless. Similarly, being a woman in the technology industry can be lonely and isolating. The Informatics community is great, but I want to focus on further growing a community that supports women in tech. By becoming an officer in Winfo I can accomplish this goal.\nI believe I am a good candidate for the Director of PR because I value the community Winfo creates and I have experience in PR positions. I have served as a member of the PR council of my sorority and I am currently in charge of running my sorority's social media accounts. I intend to expand Winfo’s online presence by adding more social media accounts like Instagram and starting a weekly email newsletter.\nI hope you consider voting for me for Director of Public Relations for Winfo."

My name is Lee Segal and I am running for the Director of Outreach position of Winfo.\nWhen I began school at the University of Washington I was not sure what I wanted to study. After taking INFO 200 my freshman spring quarter I fell in love with Informatics and the iSchool. My favorite part about Informatics is that it combines technology, creativity, data, and knowledge, while fostering the iSchool community.\nAfter joining the Informatics major I discovered Winfo and ran to be one of Winfo’s first year representatives. Holding this position this past year has been an incredibly rewarding experience. I helped plan a diverse array of events including the hack-a-thon and the student job panel that encouraged informatics students to pursue a career in something that they love.\nBeing a Winfo first year rep has given me the unique advantage of working with each officer individually, which is how I came to the realization that the Director of Outreach position is perfect for me. With my combination of organizational, communication, and social skills, along with my love for Winfo (what it supports and stands for) I know that I will be driven to accomplish amazing things in this role.\nI want to be an officer for the students of the iSchool, making sure that as many as possible are benefiting from company tours, networking nights, alumni panels, student job panels, and any other events we host. I will listen to students’ needs and interests, and gain feedback about companies or the types of events that we host, ensuring that your requests become reality as I am an officer here to serve you. My main goal is help students cultivate long lasting beneficial relationships with companies and alumni. I think with my skill set and passion will empower me to make a difference in this position.\nI love being involved with Winfo because of all the people I have been able to meet and all the students I have been able to impact thus far.

I was blessed to be accepted into the major in the most competitive year to date and I want to give back as your next Winfo Director of Outreach.\nWinfo has a special place in my heart because it was one of the main factors that made me fall in love with Informatics. I first fell in love while taking Info 200 with Dr. Stearns. I confirmed my love for the major when I went to a Winfo professional networking event and saw everybody’s love and passion for the major. I immediately knew I was at home.\nAfter receiving my acceptance to the major, I knew I wanted to share this opportunity with other prospective and current informatics students. I strongly believe that it is a valuable experience to hear industry leaders’ stories, especially as women leaders in the technology industry. Their failure and success stories could be reflected in our futures. And many students seem to not know how to take advantage of these opportunities. I want to open these doors of opportunity - whether that be through networking nights, company tours, industry leader speed dating nights, or alumni panels.\nBy utilizing my networking skills and ability to communicate the values of Informatics to employers and recruiters, I want to give back to Winfo by maintaining alumni connections and planning professional events.\nAs the Director of Outreach, I want to not only be the bridge between Informatics and the industry, but also between the students and alumni.

My work at admissions deeply resonated with me as I remembered the time I was schooling in India, hesitant yet excited to move to another country for college. Having the opportunity to work in that space made me realize how much I enjoyed interacting with different people about the culture and circumstances they grew up in.\nDiversity has played a major role in shaping my college experience. This past year, I served as the Director of Outreach for Tech++, an organization that strives to empower women to capitalize on technology in different career paths. Working with these amazing women and planning events based on this objective served as an incredible experience. Moving forward, I want to engage and collaborate with different organizations to put up a range of diverse events.\nWinfo, IUGA and the Informatics staff and faculty have already done an incredible job in nurturing a sense of diversity, and as the Director of Diversity Efforts, I will strive to maintain and expand on this existing momentum.\nSo vote for Anushree Shukla as your Director of Diversity Efforts!\n#ShakeItUp4Shukla\nThank you!"

				statement: "Hello, my name is Stefani Sanchez and I’m running to be Winfo’s next Director of Diversity Efforts. As a student in the Informatics and Speech & Hearing Sciences majors, I’m passionate about working with diverse communities & cultures. This includes informing others about what diversity encompasses, increasing awareness, and being an advocate for diversity. These actions are crucial in defining what it means to being committed to promoting and seeking diversity and are part of my motivation in running for this position. \nWhile attending UW, I’ve gained more passion and commitment to working towards diversity through my academics and extracurricular activities, more specifically within my sorority which strongly promotes cultural pride and awareness. For the past year, I have been involved as President, cultural awareness, and community service chair. I’ve been able to work closely with other multicultural organizations that are part of the United Greek Council and organizations affiliated with the ECC. I’ve had the opportunity to develop relationships with the members of these organizations and experience more of their culture by supporting their events. My involvement with my sorority and the ECC has provided me with many opportunities to learn about other cultures and broadened my world perspective. \nBased on my experience, one thing I would like to focus on as Director of Diversity Efforts is recruiting first and second year students from different backgrounds to the major and to Winfo. This would help expand awareness of Informatics as a major and help provide students with professional and academic opportunities. Another thing I’d like to incorporate as Director of Diversity Efforts is more involvement with the ECC and their organizations. \nI am strongly committed to help contribute and expand Winfo and the iSchool’s efforts to promoting and seeking diversity. I am excited to run for this position and will work towards sharing my passion and commitment towards diversity with prospective students, current students, and faculty."

				statement: "I hope to become your next Director of Diversity Efforts to do my part in encouraging women to develop and pursue their interest in information science and technology. I have been lucky enough to join such organizations like Winfo, and have seen the profound impact diversity efforts have on students. The encouraging and open community helps bring students the courage to take chances at opportunities. As a second year in Informatics, I have seen many students’ growth in their academic and professional careers due to the support they receive from amazing organizations such as Winfo. \nI am a WiSE (Women in Science and Engineering) scholar alumni, and that experience has largely shaped me to being who I am today. The organization gave me a voice when I was too timid to, and helped me have the courage to apply to Informatics the summer after my freshman year. Ever since I have been accepted, I have experienced a wonderful, accepting environment from everyone in the department, and I want to do the same for all the next incoming Informatics students. Winfo, in particular, is especially great at welcoming women into the field, and I hope to give back and be the one to welcome others. \nAs a Director of Diversity Efforts, I plan to work closely with the Office of Minority Affairs and Diversity to create events geared towards empowering women and any other historically underrepresented groups. In the iSchool, I want to collaborate with iWorld, iQueeries, and iEquality to bring perspectives of other clubs to Winfo. To do so, I plan to have speakers from different organizations to come and talk about their experiences in industry in Winfo general meetings, and host events geared towards diversity. \nDiversity is about empowering women and minorities, but it is also about influencing an entire STEM field to have more diverse thought. I want to also encourage men and absolutely everyone to join in on the discussion of diversity. Diverse ideas are what shapes better products in industry, and better communities of people."

I’m currently a junior and first year in Informatics, and I’m focusing on the HCI design track. \nI have been in Informatics community for almost two quarters, and I absolutely loved it and truly felt like this is a second home for me. As an international student, my parents are away from me most of the time. However, everyone is so friendly and helpful to each other in Info. When I stayed up late doing projects at the TE lab with my friends, I really felt the connection I made with these people. And I love all the materials and projects we do here. I feel less homesick when I’m into designing, and doing other info class projects. Therefore, I want to bring more people to join us, and especially more international students to attend to our Winfo events. \nI want to join the Winfo’s family because I have always been interested in gender equality issues. And after I took INFO102, I realized we need more women and their voice in the technology field. I believe in empowering women in the technology field can change the world. So, I hope to be in part of WINFO team, and bring fun events to empower women to join and explore about informatics and the technology field. I’m a good candidate for creative director because I have a passion towards design. I love to design ANYTHING. To become a good designer, the most important thing to remember is to think from another person’s perspective. I am good at communicating and getting to know what people really want. So, if I become the creative director, I would definitely communicate to the other Winfo officers to discuss about my design, and also ask people who are interested in our events to get their suggestions, too. My goal is to make everyone feel interested and excited about our event not only because of the content of it, but also by looking at our poster and feel like the poster of the event is professional and attractive to them! \nThank you for your vote!"

My name is Yiran and I am really excited to be running for next Creative Director of Women in Informatics! \nDesign is a thing that I’ve enjoyed in doing for many years. Before my college life, I was a professional badminton player. Due to this special role, I did not have lots of chance to study any knowledge about design. However, the concept of design grew up in my mind. Back to a few years ago, I got an idea that redesigning the abandoned badminton birdies into key chains. At the beginning, I just designed the birdies for fun, but they later attracts lots of people’s eyes and people even wanted to buy them. This might be my very beginning experience related to design. \nAfter getting into UW, I still kept my passion on design because I believe design is my thing and is what can really improve the quality of people’s lives. You may ask me, why not majoring in design? But you know, iSchool is my school. This community is something I have felt being part of it inherently since I first took INFO 200. What it taught me is above the knowledge it self, it also taught me studying is not just about competition that I’ve been doing many years in badminton, and teamwork is also essential. \nI’ve enjoyed my roles being a designer in different students associations, clubs, and class teams. I am passionate to keep on this journey to be a Creative Director of women in technology. I hope to strengthen this community with my creativity and foster the success of the informatics community. \nThank you for your vote!"

One of the most memorable experiences on the trip was on a 24 hour train ride from Mumbai to Bangalore. This journey was when I got to really know my fellow INFO students who are incredibly adventurous and motivated. As WINFO president, I hope to encourage involvement in this community full of remarkable individuals and create bonds like the ones I made while abroad. As a woman in STEM I advocate to bridge the gender gap in the tech industry. I have been a teacher for Girls Who Code where I encouraged learning and was a role model for girls pursuing technology. Each week, I would come up with motivating lesson plans to teach young women how to program. To me, teaching the girls how to code is much more than just teaching a new skill—it is shaping the future of our field. As WINFO president, I hope to empower women to find confidence and strength in the technology field. Even through the multiple INFO group projects, nothing has tested my leadership more than being a TA for INFO 101. Let’s face it, college students have a hard time paying attention in class but make it a late-night, 2 hour class and led by someone the same age as you…it can be challenging to say the least. What has helped me the most is my motivation to ignite a passion in my students for the informatics field. As president I will be a driven leader and work to inspire others to love informatics and the community we cultivate. Through involvement, empowerment and driven leadership I am confidence I will succeed in this position!"

Reflecting back on my experiences at the iSchool, I realized how much I’ve grown as a person. I wouldn’t be the person I am today without the inclusive and inspiring community I found here. Through Informatics, I found a community of supportive individuals who have gone out of their way to help me succeed. My INFO 200 TA inspired me with the innovative projects he had created throughout his time in the major and helped each of us define what Informatics meant to us. Therefore, I feel the value of supporting the next generations to come. Through support and inspiration, we get the opportunity to continue this unique community that we are so lucky to have found. As an INFO 200 TA and INFO Peer Advisor, I have challenged my leadership and communication skills to inspire and support the next generation of Informatics students. I’m grateful to contribute to the major that I love so much. Helping students navigate classes, requirements, and applications, I have learned how to empathize, communicate, and find solutions as a Peer Advisor. Through presenting in large lectures, grading, and working on a team with other TA’s, I have challenged myself in my leadership and analytic skills. Through these experiences, I got to give back to my community and grow as an individual. Being a woman in technology, I understand the value of women’s unique perspectives. It’s difficult to feel comfortable in a field dominated by men, but with the support and professional connections that Winfo caters, we can make our ideas heard.

My ideas include increasing our social media presence across multiple apps, creating video content of our events for marketing and information purposes, and raising awareness of our club through University publications and with corporate relationships.  For example, the team has found this past year that many students aren’t aware of our events because they are not active on Facebook.  By bringing the content to them through more popular apps such as Instagram or Snapchat, I believe we would have better event turnouts.   Some of that content could be fun clips of our events that will help bring them to life.

It is valuable to hear other’s adventures and understand that many of the struggles that we face aren’t uncommon and something that many in the industry has struggled as well. Informatics is a unique program, created by the diverse community and devoted individuals. We all work extremely hard on our projects and coursework and I want to help translate the effort in our classroom beyond academia and into the professional world whether that is industry or research.

Two fun facts about me: I was born in Guatemala and grew up in Seattle. I also originally started off as a violin music major in New Orleans and slowly found my way to this amazing program. One thing that attracted me to the iSchool was its transparency about its goal of creating more diverse cohorts and its continuing conversations, efforts, and actions towards accomplishing this goal. I have further loved being a part of Winfo and a community of women who are always happily willing to uplift and support all communities and work as a supportive, fun team. I’ve learned so much, from being able to help with our continuing conversation on the iSchool diversity blueprint, by helping with various panels of women in technology, by working the ins and outs of Winfo’s Hackathon, and by helping start to lead an outreach initiative to local community colleges. As an officer of diversity, I plan to continue outreach to foster Winfo’s continued relationships with K-12 schools.

Once I researched the tracks and took INFO 200 (with the legendary Andy Ko), I found out about human-computer interaction, and user interface/user experience design, and as someone who loves to design things, I knew I wanted to do just that, and that’s how I found my passion for design. Since then, I have taken every opportunity to practice my design skills, and running for the position of WINFO Creative Director allows me to do more of that. As the Creative Director, I want to bring my ideas to life by designing event banners, posters, and best of all, the swag! When creating the next designs for WINFO, it would be awesome to get feedback and suggestions from the iSchool community in terms of what they want to see, as the Informatics brand reflects who we all are.

I’ve been pursuing informatics ever since which has gifted me with experiences like the iSchool and OMA&D Tahiti study abroad program I attended at the end of last summer. I went not knowing a single other person and met some of the most wonderful people who I still keep in contact with to this day. In general, I enjoy being faced with a challenge and appreciate any opportunity to be pushed out of my comfort zone and, I love encouraging others to do the same. Being an officer for WINFO would allow me to become more involved with the Informatics community but also the chance to be part of a team that is actively empowering women. I was inspired by the opportunity to do informatics but I believe it is important that women are inspired more by examples of women succeeding in the tech industry. That being said, as Director of Outreach, not only will I utilize my communication skills to grow our Alumni Network and provide new and exciting outside activities with employers and organizations, but I also hope to connect our community with more female role models. Something that stuck with me from Tahiti was to “value the relationship”, a phrase that is applicable to all people involved in our college careers like our peers, advisors, professors, potential employers, recruiters, etc. I hope to be able to ignite those important relationships to help kick start everyone’s professional journey after college.",

After conducting some research, I stumbled upon Informatics. This program is not only a perfectly blend of my two passions but is also filled with incredible people who do truly amazing work. Because of this, I instantly knew that I wanted to become more involved. This past year I’ve been immensely grateful to be a WINFO First-Year Representative. This gave me the opportunity facilitate a variety of different diversity efforts put forth by WINFO. These experiences have opened my eyes to the wonderful work the iSchool does to make our community a better place, and I am eager to be a part of it! I believe that I could best apply my skills and passion in the role of WINFO’s Director of Diversity. My vision for diversity within the iSchool focuses around two central points. First, as Director of Diversity, I would continue to foster outreach to high school and community college students to encourage a diverse array of prospective students to apply to Informatics. Secondly, I would emphasize efforts to support current minoritized communities within the iSchool. These efforts would focus specifically on mental health support and community building opportunities. The Mental Health Power Hour I helped plan and implement this quarter was an incredible bonding experience that I would like to continue and expand throughout my year as Director of Diversity. Overall, I would seek opportunities for INFO to embrace the inclusion and intersectionality of all its members. I would be honored to have the opportunity to promote and support the diversity efforts of the iSchool as WINFO’s next Director of Diversity. Thank you!",

My path to Informatics, like the paths of many others in the iSchool community, has been a bumpy but rewarding ride.\nWhen I was a young, I loved being artistic, whether it be turning tissues into flowers or cardboard into mini-furniture for my Build-A-Bear box. This passion, however, faded as I grew older and focused on my studies. My parents wanted me to become a doctor (ಥ◡ಥ) so all of my time was dedicated to acing my science courses in high school. At one point senior year though, I broke down and realized I couldn't do pre-med in college. Thus, I entered UW clueless and unsure whether I would find a major fit for me. But then I took INFO200 and my life changed forever.\nInformatics reignited my passion for creating and made me realize the importance of design in our everyday lives. After realizing I could pursue a career in designing for good, I’ve worked hard to grow as a designer. I’ve taken design, HCDE, and HCI-focused Informatics classes and learned the tools of the trade. I am also SUDO’s current Creative Director so I have experience making graphics for a club.\nAs WINFO Creative Director, I would create merch/posters that align with the iSchool’s brand and bring a little joy into your life.

I am running for Creative Director because I believe my experiences have prepared me well for this role. How so? Last year, I was the Vice President of Marketing for DSP, a professional business organization on campus. In this role, I had the opportunity to orchestrate our fall and winter recruitment marketing efforts including researching previous themes and materials to learn and grow from the past, communicating with members to better understand what designs they wanted to represent the organization, creating videos, and designing graphics and apparel. In addition, I’ve had the opportunity to co-found and serve as the Officer of Marketing for Business Leaders of Faith, another RSO on campus. In this role, I’ve designed numerous graphics, fliers, and our Instagram page. I hope to apply these experiences, combined with feedback from the Winfo community, to best communicate, design, and contribute to a team that will empower women in technology.\nSome background and fun facts about me:\n\t- I’m studying Informatics (admitted with the Autumn 2019 cohort!), Marketing, and minoring in Dance.\n\t- I work as the iSchool Career Services Student Assistant.

Coming to the UW, I was interested in tech, but I didn’t see a clear avenue on how I could enter the industry. After taking INFO200 with Amy Ko, I was introduced to design thinking and began to see a purpose to why I wanted to pursue tech. I wanted to promote inclusivity and allow users to feel represented within the tech I created, and I found how UX design fulfilled that for me.  Since being a part of the iSchool community, I’ve found myself surrounded by other students who want to leverage technology to make a positive impact on the community around us.\nGrowing up, whenever I looked to famous tech leaders, I rarely saw women of color like me who I could look for an example of what it’s like in technology. In and out of technology, I’m emotionally invested creating welcoming and diverse environments. WINFO directly resonates with my values of focusing on women in technology. I want to contribute more directly to the WINFO community by serving as the Creative Director so that my actions may reflect my values. My emotional investment with WINFO coupled with my interest in design would serve well in the Creative Director position. I personally believe that one of the most important aspects of being a designer is creating channels of feedback for my work. Input is important to me as I would be creating designs for posters and apparel for the Info community! I would want all community members to have a voice and feel like these designs are made for them. As the potential next Creative Director of WINFO, I intend to invest myself fully and to further the goals of WINFO through a creative platform. Thank you!",

This year, I was a Freshman direct-admit to Informatics and a first-generation student at the University of Washington, but through earning my Associate Degree in high school, I am currently a rising senior. In High School, I participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Adobe, Seattle. Last summer, I was a Software Engineering Intern as part of Microsoft’s High School Program where I volunteered to mentor teams from the University of Washington’s Math Academy when they attended a Hackathon at Microsoft. I also spoke on a panel for underrepresented students from Upward Bound. Programs like these are what inspire me to empower people from underrepresented backgrounds, especially women, to pursue a future in STEM.\nThe WINFO Hackathon promotes inclusivity and technical advancement in the iSchool community, and I will introduce more prize options that reflect that such as the best first-time hack, entrepreneurial hack, best design, and most brilliant idea. Not only will more prize tracks mean more winners, but it will also mean that we can give opportunities to people from diverse backgrounds and experiences an opportunity to shine. I will also work closely with iSchool alumni to increase mentorship and company sponsorship at the event. As your Hackathon Director, I also want to be your personal advocate. This includes making the iSchool spaces feel more comfortable and welcoming to every one by bringing in new furniture, seat covers, and vending machines. Finally, I will provide more opportunities for student engagement. The Microsoft Internship Program as a program called Camp Microsoft where all of the interns get to engage in weekly bonding activities such as paddle boarding, hiking, and other events. I want to expand WINFO and IUGA’s events and budget to create a \"Camp iSchool\" for us to network with each other, with mentors, and with companies outside of the university.

I have always loved business, technology, and helping people, so this class made me understand that there is a better major for me then computer science. Now, I'm happy to say I am pursuing an Informatics degree with a minor in Disability Studies. I have a passion for design and accessibility so I know this major/minor combination will give me the future I want! I am running for Hackathon Director because I love to lead people while taking into account different abilities and mindsets. In the past I was scared to participate in the hackathon, so this year I decided to volunteer. I thought it was such a cool experience and I knew I wanted to be a part of it next year in some way. I got to see first hand how much of a community Winfo is and I want to contribute to that. If elected, I want to make sure that everyone knows how the hackathon is run to make it more accessible and less scary to newcomers. Right now, I work at the DO-IT office as a student office assistant. There, I work on reconciling budgets as well as creative projects on inDesign and Photoshop. These tasks have shown me both the creative side of my workplace and the administrative side.

As a male candidate, it would be an honor to be a part of WINFO as I am extremely passionate about empowering women in technology. My focus as Hackathon Director will be to set up participants for success in their career-related goals. I’ve participated in hackathons before, including Facebook’s invite-only in Menlo Park, so I know that hackathons are a major growth (and clout) opportunity. They can also be used as a stepping stone for internships and career goals, or just a fun thing to do with friends. However, the hackathon experience and its takeaways are in the hands of the coordinator. I developed an understanding of what the tech industry needs as an incoming Software Engineer Intern at T-Mobile, former intern at Microsoft and Moss Adams. Hence, I bring a good sense of what skills industry wants to see from us. Let’s be honest, it kind of feels like you need internships to get internships. My goals as Hackathon Director are for you guys to not only have fun, but make it so you can talk about your hackathon project as relevant experience. Ultimately, helping you with internships and career goals. In all my past internships, I didn’t encounter very many women engineers. However, the few I did encounter were the most bright-minded, inclusive, and down-to-earth engineers I have ever worked with. My commitment as Hackathon Director is to deliver a bomb hackathon, so you guys can talk about it with interviews or use it as a resume booster! Doing this would mean that I can see more of you awesome women engineers in the tech industry :’).",

That way you can find exactly what you’re looking for at any time, whether you’re wondering what it’s like to be a product manager or how to beat the classic imposter syndrome.\nIn the end, I want to make sure we as the students get a kind and accepting space for us to learn and grow as people. I’d love to be there for you as your next Director of Community Efforts!",

				statement: "Hi, all! I’m Emiri Nishizawa, a freshman direct admit to the Informatics major. I am running to be your next WINFO Director of Community Efforts! \nI was introduced to Informatics and the UW iSchool in my junior year of high school when I attended the UW WiSE conference. My friends and I had started a WiSE (Women in Science and Engineering) club earlier that year. Our focus was to introduce ourselves and others to the different opportunities within STEM. We also worked to learn about women’s experience in those fields. The iSchool advisor’s presentation at one of our meetings opened my eyes to the world of Informatics. I became interested in Informatic’s goals of working with technology to better the world. \nThrough many experiences, I have gained leadership experience that I hope to utilize and expand upon. In addition to co-leading the WiSE club with my friends, I was the co-captain for both my high school and club swim team. As an introvert myself, I find it important and fun to find ways to bring people within a community together. Through my journey at the iSchool, I hope to connect with more people in the diverse community. I am grateful for the opportunities and relationships that WINFO has provided me with, especially as a first-time college student during a pandemic. I was part of the Hackathon Committee this year that aided in planning the Hackathon and the preceding events. As the Director of Community Efforts, I hope to give back to the WINFO and iSchool community that welcomed me so warmly. \nThank you so much for your time, and I hope you consider me as your WINFO Director of Community Efforts.

				statement: "Hi INFO! My name is Sharon, and I am running to be your next WINFO Hackathon Director! I am currently a junior in Informatics and Economics pursuing the custom track focusing on software development and data science. As someone passionate about women empowerment in tech, I am thrilled by the opportunity to be a part of an inclusive community that values diversity and inclusion and be coordinating one of the largest events in the iSchool!\nLike many students at UW, the WINFO Hackathon was the first collegiate hackathon I have ever attended. For me, it was inspiring to see students with different coding and design backgrounds collaborating on such impactful projects that address a wide array of issues. As your next WINFO Hackathon Director, I want to continue bringing these experiences that promote inclusivity, accessibility, and social good. In addition to that, I aim to make the experience even better by incorporating more workshops, prizes/tracks, mentorship, and networking opportunities, to further emphasize and reflect the great diversity within hackers. \nHaving attended hackathons as a hacker and organized an online hackathon last month as the Co-Director of Tech at TechTogether Seattle, I have gained significant experiences and insights into the necessary preparation and implementation that ensure a successful running of a hackathon. For the past school year, my RSO involvement through SUDO and the Society of Women Engineers at UW has also allowed me to build strong leadership and make meaningful connections with other students. I believe that these cumulative experiences make me a strong candidate for the role of Hackathon Director! \nThank you for taking the time to read my personal statement, and please support me in the running for WINFO's next Hackathon Director! I can't wait to serve this supportive and growing community!",
